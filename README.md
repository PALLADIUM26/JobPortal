# JobPortal
This is a basic CUI based Job Portal, made using Python. MySQL was used for DBMS.

For proper functioning of this, you must have Python and MySQL installed in your systems. Especially mysql.connector, pickle and smtplib packages of python must be installed before using.
Run the Main.py file to start using this.

Here you can sign up and sign in as Employer and Employee for different uses. There is also place for Admin to maintain the portal and databases.
While running for first time, the ADMIN will be asked to enter the credentials of the MySQL. Enter the correct credentials for smooth functioning.

There are various functionalities added for both Employers, Employees and Admins as well.
While signing up there will be otp verification.
Employers will be able to post jobs and accept applocations.
Employees can search for jobs and apply.
Users can update their account too.

This project is not complete and still need to add more functionalities and make it better.
You can contact me through my social media handles (given in bio) for suggestions or rectifications.

Thank You.
